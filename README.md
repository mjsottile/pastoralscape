Please see the tagged releases for versions corresponding to the ISESSAH 2019 poster / Frontiers special issue, and the most recent version under submission to JASSS.

The data included in the repository can be used with both versions, but parameter input files will need to be modified to adjust paths such that data can be found in the appropriate location in the user filesystem.
